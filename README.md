# DamnVulnerableOpenSSL

OpenSSL with some patches

## Using Docker

If you want to compile and run the server in a container, just use:

```
docker build -t damnvulnerableopenssl .
docker run -p 4433:4433 damnvulnerableopenssl
```

Then, you can e.g. use

```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:4433
```

to connect with the server.
